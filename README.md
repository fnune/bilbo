# Bilbo

My media server.

## First-time setup

### Tailscale

Within Bilbo, run `tailscale up` to register the machine on the Tailnet.

### Services

Before starting, run:

```sh
mkdir /mnt/downloads-1t/Books
mkdir /mnt/downloads-1t/Movies
mkdir /mnt/downloads-2t/Series
```

Now, configure each service:

- [NZBGet][nzbget]
  - Visit [NZBGet][nzbget]â€”the default credentials are `nzbget`/`tegbzn6789`
  - In Security: and change the username and password
  - In Paths: set `MainPath` to `/mnt/downloads-1t/.nzbget`
  - In Categories: set the `DestDir` for "Books", "Movies" and "Series" to
    `/mnt/downloads-{1,2}t/{Books,Movies,Series}`, and whatever else is necessary
  - In News Servers: configure your server
    - Use port `563` for SSL
    - Enable encryption
    - Bump the connection limit to whatever your server allows (`50`)
- [Radarr][radarr] and [Sonarr][sonarr], and other "arr"s
  - For Radarr, go to Settings -> Profiles and set the language to "Original"
    in all profiles
  - For both:
    - Go to Settings -> Indexers and add NZBGeek
    - Go to Settings -> Download Clients and add NZBGet
- [Jellyfin][jellyfin]
  - Visit [Jellyfin][jellyfin] and create the admin user
  - Create a media library for Movies in `/mnt/downloads-1t/Movies`
  - Create a media library for Series in `/mnt/downloads-2t/Series`
